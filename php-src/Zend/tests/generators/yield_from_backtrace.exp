Implicit foreach:
int(1)
#0  gen() called at [%s:%d]
int(2)
#0  from(2) called at [%s:%d]
#1  gen() called at [%s:%d]
int(3)
#0  gen() called at [%s:%d]

Explicit iterator:
int(1)
#0  gen()
#1  Generator->next() called at [%s:%d]
int(2)
#0  from(2) called at [%s:%d]
#1  gen()
#2  Generator->next() called at [%s:%d]
int(3)
#0  gen()
#1  Generator->next() called at [%s:%d]

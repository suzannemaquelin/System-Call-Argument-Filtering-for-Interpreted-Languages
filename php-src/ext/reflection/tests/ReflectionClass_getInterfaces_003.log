---- EXPECTED OUTPUT
An object is in an array and is referenced. As expected, var_dumping the array shows '&':
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  &object(stdClass)#%d (0) {
  }
}
Naturally, this remains true if we modify the object:
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  &object(stdClass)#%d (1) {
    ["x"]=>
    int(1)
  }
}


Obtain the array of interfaces implemented by C.
The result is an array in which each element is an object (an instance of ReflectionClass)
Var_dumping this array shows that the elements are referenced. By what?
array(1) {
  ["I"]=>
  object(ReflectionClass)#%d (1) {
    ["name"]=>
    string(1) "I"
  }
}
Modify the object, and it is apparently no longer referenced.
array(1) {
  ["I"]=>
  object(ReflectionClass)#%d (2) {
    ["name"]=>
    string(1) "I"
    ["x"]=>
    int(1)
  }
}
